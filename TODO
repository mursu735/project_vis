# TODO:
# Add more words (1000 random words) (DONE)
# Spot the exact time (DONE) and location for outbreak start (Add animation for outbreak), 
# Add alpha to map (DONE)
# Spot the first message (?)
# Check for more symptoms
# Heatmap of features, similarity of similarity; create a vector of similarity for all symptoms, then compare the similarity of those vectors (cosine) (DONE, maybe)
# https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/cluster/plot_agglomerative_dendrogram.html?highlight=clustering
# Self organized map
Train two models
Collection of words
Term frequency correlation
Plot different symptoms at different colors; regular flu as well
List messages under slider, or something like that
Separate texts between normal flu and outbreak (binary classifier, training with messages before and after), ADD LEGEND
Piechart, different symptoms
Summarize by Each district, proportion, bar chart, use edited map to figure out the district, then plot them accordingly based on symptoms
Segregate pre-ob words that suggest 
4 class vector classifier, (1 and 2 for outbreak, 3 for normal flu)
